### Need Airtight System?

CapRover uses many services for hosting code, building, health control, and running, such as GitHub, Google, Docker Hub and etc. It also hosts many 3rd party apps, either in form of plugins (such as NetData) or One-Click apps. These apps may use 3rd party services, i.e. their backend services. If you need to run CapRover in an airtight situation, for example an environment that doesn't have access to the internet, please contact us for private support `support at/caprover/dot/com`.
